        The following are components of the Metaverse that need to work together in order to bring this technology into
        reality.
        <div class="timeline">
            <div>
                <h4 class="label success">Hardware</h4>
                <p>First, we need enterprise hardware used to create these virtual worlds. A good example is the
                    hardware
                    that
                    Hollywood studios use to create scenes using cameras, object tracking systems and sensors). We also
                    need
                    consumer-facing hardware such as VR headsets, mobile phones, and haptic gloves to read in the
                    virtual
                    worlds.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="label success">Networking</h4>
                <p>The current Internet network infrastructure (TCP/IP and its layers) need to support a significantly
                    higher number of real-time connections and more data (since the file sizes will be large).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="label success">Compute</h4>
                <p>The ability to perform physics calculation, rendering, syncing, as well as AI.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="label success">Interchange Tools and Standards</h4>
                <p>There needs interoperability in this new technology. For example, no one company owns the Internet,
                    instead, we have a open standards that anyone can use to build websites and join the global network.
                    Similarly, we need to create a similar standard for the Metaverse. For instance, Amazon can build a
                    "shopping world" and make it available to everyone just like their <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com">website</a> is
                    available to anyone with an Internet device, yet Amazon doesn't "own" the Internet.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="label success">Payments</h4>
                <p>Digital Payments are a critical component of the Metaverse. The vision here is to have a mature
                    crypto
                    network advanced enough to support as many transactions as Visa's and Mastercard's network.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="label success">Metaverse Content, Services, and Assets</h4>
                <p>This equivalent to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">Apple App Store</a> or the <a
                        href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=en_US&gl=US">Google Play
                        Store</a>. Those two sites provide a seamless way to access
                    apps/"experiences". There should be a similar platform for the Metaverse as well so users can jump
                    from
                    world to world seamlessly.</p>
